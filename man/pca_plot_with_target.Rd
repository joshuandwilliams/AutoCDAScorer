\title{Scatter Plot of PCA-Transformed Features with Confidence Ellipses}
\usage{
pca_plot_with_target(
  original_features,
  new_features,
  explained_variance,
  PC_a,
  PC_b,
  num_pcs,
  num_ellipses = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{original_features}{A matrix of original features transformed by PCA.}

\item{new_features}{A matrix of new features transformed by PCA.}

\item{explained_variance}{A numeric vector of explained variance ratios for each principal component.}

\item{PC_a}{An integer indicating the index of the first principal component for plotting.}

\item{PC_b}{An integer indicating the index of the second principal component for plotting.}

\item{num_pcs}{An integer representing the total number of principal components used in PCA.}

\item{num_ellipses}{An integer specifying the number of ellipses to draw for visualizing data spread (default: 3).}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object representing the PCA scatter plot with confidence ellipses.
}
\description{
This function creates a scatter plot of original and new features transformed by PCA,
highlighting the distribution of data points along two selected principal components.
It also overlays confidence ellipses to visualize the data spread.
