\title{Perform PCA on Extracted Features}
\usage{
run_pca(features, num_pcs = 10, savepath = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{features}{An array of extracted features (output from \code{extract_features()}).}

\item{num_pcs}{Integer. The number of principal components to retain. Default is 10.}

\item{savepath}{Character. Optional file path to save the PCA model as an RDS file. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{pca}{A \code{prcomp} object containing the trained PCA model.}
\item{features_pca}{A matrix of transformed features after applying PCA.}
}
\description{
This function applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extracted image features,
reducing their dimensionality. Optionally, it can save the PCA model as an RDS file.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
features <- extract_features(model, images)
pca_result <- run_pca(features, num_pcs = 10, savepath = "pca_model.rds")
}
